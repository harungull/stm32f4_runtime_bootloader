1)This project was tested in STM32F407.If you work with another board or have complex .hex file, you should be ensure about your implementation.
2)simple project's base flash address is setted as "sector 0". For avoid possible errors occurs when writing to flash,
stm32_runtime_bootloader project's flash base address is changed as "sector 5" in System_Init function(SCB->VTOR = 0x08020000;) 
3)simple project's hex file has 1771 lines. In project, "usb_receive_buffer" has 2048 number of lines.
4)If you wanna use this project directly, you should not use reset button in board. If you used it, program would start with default base address not from 0x08020000.
